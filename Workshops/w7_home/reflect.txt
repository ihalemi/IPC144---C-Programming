1. The advantage of passing values from a function through its parametres rather than through its return value is that these values passed as arguments in the parametres can be anything from variables, expressions, structs etc. Moreover, these values will remain unmodified in most cases and the return value like in this workshop can be used for other purposes like validation of the phone numbers.
2. Usually when derefrencing is used, it is used along side a pointer. Derefrencing a pointer means using the * to access the value stored at a pointer. However, the value stored at the address of the pointer must be a value of the same type as the type of variable the pointer "points to".
3. A pointer stores a value which is the address of another variable for instance the direct address of the mmemory location of a variable.
